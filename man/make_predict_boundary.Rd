\item{col_name_val}{Value to provide in the column in the resulting mcp}

\item{clip}{sf. Clip the resulting mcp back to this.}

\item{out_crs}{Numeric. \href{https://epsg.io/}{epsg} code}

\item{return_poly}{Logical. Return the mcp, or alternatively \code{out_file}}

\item{force_new}{Logical. If \code{out_file} exists, recreate it?}

\value{
If \code{return_poly}, sf, else \code{out_file}. .parquet mcp written to
\code{out_file}

\description{
Primary use is to create a predict boundary for \code{prep_sdm()}, merging (an
existing) minimum convex polygon around points with other sources of taxa
distribution. Optionally, applying a buffer around the resulting mcp; and
clipping to a (usually coastal) boundary. The predict boundary is then used
for generation of background points and for masking the 'full' predict (to
the full extent of the environmental variables.
